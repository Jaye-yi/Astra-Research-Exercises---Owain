Explanation: This sentence primarily describes the city skyline and urban architecture, but it also mentions the natural element of light through the sunset.
- Through this result we find that GPT-4 could identify the city element and natural element, and based on the rule it described earlier, it should give the sentence with both label{C} and label{W}, but it only give label {C}, this might because that GPT-4 treat the priority of weather and city higher than natural elements. Thus, I used another prompt to ask it the potential priority difference.

Explanation: The revised labels now include both {C} (for city/cityscape) and {W} (for weather/natural elements) for the sentences that mention both aspects.
-Here we find that LLM start to get confusion about the labels. Although it appologize here, I think it is just a format of revision. The LLM is still confusion about weather and natural and the priority among weather, natural and city elements.

Follow up prompt:
What do you think about the priority between weather, natuarl and city elements for label{W} and {C}?

Answers:
In terms of priority, labeling the elements for {W} (weather) and {C} (city) would be as follows:

Weather elements have the highest priority and should be labeled as {W}. These include sentences that specifically describe weather conditions such as rain, snow, wind, temperature, fog, thunderstorm, and so on.
Natural elements have a medium priority and should also be labeled as {W}, but only if the sentence primarily focuses on the natural aspect and not the city. These include mentions of natural elements such as flowers, trees, rivers, coastlines, stars, and other nature-related imagery.
City elements have the lowest priority and should be labeled as {C}. These include descriptions of the city skyline, buildings, streets, landmarks, urban activities, transportation, and other city-specific features.
Please note that the prioritization may vary based on the context and specific requirements.


- I reload the model and ran the exact training and testing data several times. And got similar answers.
we can see that the model is able to predict labels with very high accuracy, but it cannot articulate the rule. Althought it cannot articulate the rule, it can still find a relatively reliable rule to classify the sentences. Through the final prompt question about priorities, we find that the model is actually able to faithfully explains the LLM’s behavior, though the behavior given wrong answers - identify natural elements as label {W}.
